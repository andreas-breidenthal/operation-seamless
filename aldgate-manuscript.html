          [Archivist's note: The following is a full transcript of the handwritten document recovered on 9 April 2021 from 47 Aldgate High Street, London EC3. Minor transcription conventions applied. Original orthography preserved throughout.]
        </div>

        <div class="ms-body">

          <p>I have kept this to myself for six months, believing it best not spoken. But I find I can no longer bear the silence.</p>

          <p>I was present on the night PC Reeve and Sergeant Melrose lost their lives. The accounts given in the papers do not reflect what occurred.</p>

          <p>The London Gazette called it "a shocking discovery." The Evening Standard said, "Jack the Ripper was unmasked — a police constable all along."</p>

          <p>I heard of it from customers the following morning.</p>

          <div class="street-voices">
            <span class="street-voice">Reeve found dead. Stabbed. Lost his mind.</span>
            <span class="street-voice">Melrose tried to stop him.</span>
            <span class="street-voice">He carved his initials into her — J.T.R. — same as his name.</span>
            <span class="street-voice">He signed it. Jack the Ripper.</span>
          </div>

          <p>I did not speak of it, neither to the police nor to others. My reasons for silence are explained below.</p>

          <p>I witnessed the events directly. The man responsible was Percival Kerr, formerly Chief Inspector.</p>

          <p>I am certain of what I saw. The circumstances of my presence are set out below.</p>

          <p>At the time, certain details appeared unusual. It later became clear that the scene had been arranged to implicate PC Reeve.</p>

          <p>I was engaged in unlawful activity at the time and would not have been considered a credible witness by the authorities.</p>

          <p>My presence at the location was deliberate, owing to criminal intent.</p>

          <p>On the evening of Sunday, 25 November 1888, after the public houses had closed and the streets were quiet, I went out intending to steal. The fog was thick over Bishopsgate. My destination was the Magpie, a public house on New Street, just off the main road.</p>

          <p>The street was formerly called Hand Alley. Though renamed, the old name remained in common use.</p>

          <p>I came in from Bishopsgate, climbed the wall, and positioned myself on the ledge above the front of the building, level with the first storey. I had brought an iron tool to break in through a window.</p>

          <p>Before I began, I heard footsteps at the far end of the alley. I remained still. The person did not pass beneath me but halted near the corner.</p>

          <p>The alley bends sharply at that point, with the Magpie situated on the corner. I moved along the ledge to get a better view.</p>

          <p>From the ledge, I saw PC Reeve standing beside the body of Clara Fenwick. He was holding a lantern. I knew him by sight, having seen him on patrol before. The woman was unfamiliar to me at the time.</p>

          <p>He placed the lantern on the ground and knelt beside the woman. At some point, he took up the locket.</p>

          <p>He appeared to be examining the woman's injuries and comparing them to the engravings on the locket. I could not see clearly from my position, but reports the next day described the wounds in detail.</p>

          <p>The exact sequence is unclear. At one point, Reeve reached for her arm and drew back holding a severed hand.</p>

          <p>This is how he came to be in possession of the hand.</p>

          <p>The scene appeared staged. The location, formerly known as Hand Alley, may have been chosen intentionally.</p>

          <p>Sergeant Melrose arrived at the scene unexpectedly. I did not observe his approach, and Reeve appeared startled.</p>

          <p>I did not see Melrose take the lantern, but only one was recovered, broken, the next morning. He was holding it when he stepped back after seeing the severed hand.</p>

          <p>He fell, and the lantern struck the cobbles and broke. The flame went out, and the alley was left in darkness.</p>

          <p>I recall clearly that a voice was heard shortly after the lantern broke. It was unfamiliar and came without warning.</p>

          <p>At the time, I did not know who had spoken, but it was soon evident that the man was Percival Kerr, formerly Chief Inspector.</p>

          <p>He lit a candle, and I recognised him by his appearance, which matched the likeness published in the papers upon his retirement.</p>

          <p>It appeared he had been present throughout. He stood calmly and did not intervene.</p>

          <p>Reeve spoke his name aloud, confirming his identity. Melrose also addressed him directly after regaining composure.</p>

          <p>Reeve and Kerr spoke briefly, and their voices were raised.</p>

          <p>The words later reported by the young witness, found by police in Rose Alley the next morning, were likely spoken during this exchange.</p>

          <p>This detail was noted in the incident report and repeated in most of the papers.</p>

          <p>The scene became disorderly. Kerr may have drawn a blade. The candle was extinguished during the struggle, and I could see little thereafter.</p>

          <p>I cannot state the exact sequence of events that followed. However, I did observe Kerr standing over the bodies of Reeve and Melrose.</p>

          <p>After Kerr left, I also departed. I did not attempt to determine whether either man was still alive.</p>

          <p>I returned to the shop, secured the door, and went to my room. I remained awake, thinking of what I had seen.</p>

          <p>In the morning, I heard movement downstairs. News of the incident had begun to circulate.</p>

          <p>Customers and passers-by spoke of it — fragments of conversation overheard throughout the day.</p>

          <p>I knew the published accounts were inaccurate, but I was a thief, present unlawfully at the scene.</p>

          <p>Had I approached the authorities, suspicion would likely have fallen on me. I possessed no evidence and therefore remained silent.</p>

          <p>I have not forgotten what occurred: Reeve accused in error, Melrose killed while intervening, and Kerr leaving the scene unchallenged.</p>

          <p>I did not speak at the time and do not expect to be believed now. But silence has become more difficult to bear than the risk of disbelief. I am unable to present this account in person, and so I leave it to be found after I am gone, in the hope that it may correct the record.</p>
